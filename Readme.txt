README


The attached files are part of the Project 1 for CS352 that I have re-written
in Ruby with RLTK (Ruby Language Toolkit).

AST.rb - Defines the AST Nodes later used for LLVM Contractor
Lexer.rb  - Defined keywords and token regex for parser
Parser.rb - Defines the grammar for creating AST
Contractor.rb - Defines how the AST nodes should interact and runs the code in
                Ruby's environment.
jsparser.rbl  - Autogenerated by Parser.rb, stores the parsing table for this
                syntax, if removed the first time execution will take 3 sec more
                than usual to generate a new table.
JS.rb     - The main ruby file that will parse the file supplied
            Use it like [ruby JS.rb input]
parser    - The bash script will behave like specified
            Use it like [./parser input]

Prerequisits - run [gem install rltk] before executing this program,
               this program will not run unless rltk is installed on the host
               machine

Performance -  The included source runs AST nodes in Ruby's environment, I have
                removed LLVM for JIT compilation since it requires llvm-3.4 and
                professor decided not to give extra credits for fast performance

Part1 & 2 of this project is written in C++, I have rewritten them in Ruby which
  is a language I am only familar with for 2 days. Please contact me or grade
  this program manually if I got less than 90 points. Thank You
